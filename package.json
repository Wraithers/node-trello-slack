It's limited to one board!\n\nThis tool will check the trello api once a minute for updates and push them into your desired channels. You can configure any number of boards.\n\n### Install\n\n\tnpm install --save node-trello-slack\n\n### Usage\n\nCreate an executable script with the following code:\n\n```js\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nvar Bot = require('node-trello-slack')\n\t,bot = new Bot({\n\t\tpollFrequency: 1000*60*3 //every 3 minutes\n\t\t,start: true\n\t\t,trello: {\n\t\t\tboards: ['Nz5nyqZg','...']\n\t\t\t,key: 'trello-key-here'\n\t\t\t,token: 'trello-token-here'\n\t\t\t,events: ['createCard','commentCard','addAttachmentToCard','updateCard','updateCheckItemStateOnCard']\n\t\t}\n\t\t,slack: {\n\t\t\tdomain: 'slack-domain-here'\n\t\t\t,token: 'slack-webhook-token-here'\n\t\t\t,channel: '#general'\n\t\t}\n\t});\n```\n\nYou may completely omit `trello.events`, which indicates that you want all (recognized) events announced. All recognized events are listed in the example above. Alternately, include some subset of the list shown above. (Case sensitive)\n\n### Trello-board-specific channels\n\nIf you want to send alerts from each board to a different Slack channel, pass object hashes instead of string board id's in the `trello.boards` array, as you see here:\n\n```js\n,trello: {\n\tboards: [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tid: 'Nz5nyqZg'\n\t\t\t,channel: '#general'\n\t\t}\n\t\t,{\n\t\t\tid: '...'\n\t\t\t,channel: '#devops'\n\t\t}\n\t]\n\t,key: 'trello-key-here'\n\t,token: 'trello-token-here'\n}\n```\n\n## Getting your Trello and Slack credentials\n\nYou'll need a **Trello key and token.** [Get your key here](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate): it's the one in the box near the top labeled \"key.\" Once you have that key, substitute it into the following url for <KEY-HERE> and open it up in a browser tab:\n\n    https://trello.com/1/connect?name=node-trello-slack&response_type=token&expiration=never&key=<KEY-HERE>\n\nYou'll also need your webhook **token and domain** for Slack. The domain is just the part of the url before `.slack.com`. To get your token, go to the following url (substituting your domain for `<YOUR-DOMAIN>`) and add the webhook integration (if it's not already enabled). The token will be listed in the left sidebar.\n\n    https://<YOUR-DOMAIN>.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook\n\nFill all four of these values into your bot config, and tweak the other options\n\n## Running...\n\nOnce you've configured access to your Trello and Slack accounts, the last thing to know is how this tool knows what events it's already seen. There are two options: File system, and Redis.\n\n### ...locally (or where the file system is writeable)\n\nThe simplest is using the file system. Just create a file named `last.id` in the root folder of the project and put the number `0` into it. As long as the filesystem is writeable the file will be updated when new board actions have been seen.\n\n### ...on Heroku (or where the file system is not writeable)\n\nI run this tool on Heroku (a single free dyno works great!) but they dont allow you to write to the filesystem. Instead, I use Redis. Add the free **Redis To Go** addon and everything should just work out of the box.\n\n    heroku create\n    heroku addons:add redistogo\n    git push heroku master\n    heroku ps:scale worker=1 && heroku logs -t\n\nThis will push whatever you've got committed in your local git repo up to a new heroku app connected to a free RedisToGo instance, running on a free Heroku worker dyno, and tail the Heroku log file -- just in case there are errors. If no errors appear after a minute or two, just hit ctrl+c to exit the log tail and go about your business.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n# The MIT License (MIT)\n\n> Copyright (c) 2014 Adam Tuttle\n\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
